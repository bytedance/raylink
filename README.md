# RayLink

RayLink is a framework that helps you easily build your own workload, connecting every working node.

It's based on [ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for now, and it has implemented several new features to improve
user experience.

RayLink was used to build a reinforcement learning framework, and tested in a large-scale multi-agent training
environment.

## Usage

Clone this project and use `pip install .` to install raylink.

## Demo
